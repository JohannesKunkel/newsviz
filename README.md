# NewsViz - A Control Panel for Managing News Aggregation

In the domain of news, it is particularly crucial to keep an overview on the different perspectives on a topic. Achieving such an overview in common news aggregating websites can be hard, if not impossible, though.

NewsViz makes use of a information visualization technique called treemap to visualize the influence of a range of news topics and publishers on a personalized newsfeed.
